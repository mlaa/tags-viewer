**TAGS Viewer** allows users to browse, explore, and search a *Twitter* archive. As a backend, it requires Martin Hawksey’s [Twitter Archive Google Spreadsheet (TAGS)][1]. TAGS provides a free, non-technical method of archiving tweets for a given hashtag, which can be particularly useful for capturing a conference’s [backchannel][2].

This application is contained in a single HTML file and has no server dependencies, which makes it easy to host anywhere: just upload a single file (this one!) and you’re done. Or, if you don’t need to share it with anyone, just double-click the file on your hard drive to open it in your Web browser. Configuration is as simple as supplying a Google Spreadsheet URL.

TAGS Viewer is a JavaScript application using [jQuery][3], [Underscore.js][4], [Moment.js][5], [jQuery Hashchange][6], [Bootstrap][7], and [Sheetrock][8].
